A framework is a ready-made foundation or set of pre-written code and rules that helps developers build software more efficiently.
It provides tools, libraries, and a structure to make development faster and more consistent.

Architecture is the overall design or structure of a software system — how different parts of the system interact and work together.
It’s a blueprint that defines:
How code is organized,
How components communicate,
How data flows through the system.
