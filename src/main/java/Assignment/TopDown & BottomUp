Top-Down Approach
In the Top-Down approach, you start with a big overall idea or system, then break it down into smaller, manageable parts or submodules.

No.
Example
Explanation
1
Software Design
Start with overall system → break into modules → functions.
2
Algorithm Design
Begin with main logic → divide into smaller subroutines.
3
Project Management (WBS)
Create project → divide into phases → tasks → subtasks.
4
Organization Structure
Company → departments → teams → employees.
5
Game Development
Start with concept → levels → characters → code each part.


Bottom Up Approach
In the Bottom-Up approach, you start with small individual components, then integrate them together to form a complete system.

No.
Example
Explanation
1
Learning to Code
Start with syntax → then write small programs → finally build full applications.
2
Assembling a Computer
Start with parts (CPU, RAM, HDD) → connect them → build the complete PC.
3
Learning a Language
Learn words → then sentences → then full conversations.
4
Team Formation
Start by hiring skilled individuals → form teams → build departments.
5
Software Testing (Unit → Integration)
Test small units first, then integrate and test the full system.
